# WIFI-Operated-Bot
This code is written for ESP32 board with L298N motor driver.
A 3-Wheeled bot which can be operated with the help of a Mobile application having wifi connection and controls.
The code was initially written to test all the functionality of the bot and later on codes for enabling and using controlled rpm of the motors using PWM pins of the ESP32 was added(can be used after uncommenting the codes).
Some of the functionality includes moving forward, backward, left, right, left_forward, left_backward, right_forward, right_backward, clockwise rotation, anti-clockwise rotation and stop.
